### Marketplace BROWSE

This part of the marketplace will allow users to browse Riot Racers assets, including those for sale.

There will be a Marketplace landing page with a side menu bar, similar to the main app when you are logged in.

This part of the Marketplace will have the following functionality:

1. A landing page that has a header graphic and a side menu bar, similar to the main app (after you are logged in). The left menu bar 
will have the following options on it:
* Marketplace Home
* Cars
* Gas Stations
* Racetrack Land
* Option to show all assets, or only those for sale

2. Once Cars is select from the left menu, the main cars page will be displayed. Here you will be able to select how you want to browse - 
by CLASS or by MODEL. To show these two options we will show the following: 

Browse by Class: Rookie, Rally, Driver, Tracker, Aero, Pro, Legendary 
* Then allow the user to sort by Car Model

Browse by Model: Show a thumbnail of all the car models, see this page https://whitepaper.riot.fun/cars/car-rarity-resources, use the Rookie 
version of each model.
* Then allow the user to sort by Car Class

3. Each Car needs to have a status indicator below the image of the car/asset that shows: Not for Sale, Available, Sale Pending, Transfer Pending. 
If the car/asset is available, include a BUY NOW button near the car.
