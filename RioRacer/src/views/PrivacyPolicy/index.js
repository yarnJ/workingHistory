        privacy and security, we are not responsible for the privacy practices

      </p>
      <h3 className="heading2 pl32">5) Does the Company use Cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        The Service, in line with almost every other internet-based company,
        utilizes cookie technology to allow the company to improve the
        functionality of the service and improve your user experience. Your
        browser or device may allow you to block or delete cookies from our
        site, however, this may interfere with the functionality of our Service.
        Cookies collect information automatically even when a user is not logged
        into their account. The information collected may include information
        about the platform and operating system you are using, your browser type
        and version, computer and connection information, and what time you
        accessed the site. This information will be collected any time you
        access the website unless you opt out.
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading3 pl32 italic">What are cookies?</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored
        on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.
        They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for
        a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat
        visits (using a “persistent cookie”). They ensure a consistent and
        efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such
        as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set
        by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or
        by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising
        or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking
        technologies such as “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are typically
        small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar
        purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies,
        though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a
        result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their
        functionality will be restricted
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading3 pl32 italic">
        Which cookies does The Company use?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Anytime you visit and use a The Company website, The Company or a third
        party places cookies in your browser. Certain cookies are specific to
        features or specific preferences, and certain cookies will be used all
        the time. Four different types of cookies are used by The Company.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Essential Cookies.</b> These are cookies are placed in your browser

          These are necessary to allow you to move around the site and use its
          features, such as “Save and View Favorites.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Analytics Cookies.</b> Also known as “performance cookies,”
          analytics cookies collect information about visits to our sites and
          how the services we offer are being used. We use this data to make
          improvements and report our performance. For example, these cookies
          collect information about how visitors use our sites, which site the
          visitor came from, the number of each user’s visits and how long a
          user stays on the site. We might also use analytics cookies to test
          new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Analytics
          cookies are primarily third-party cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Functionality Cookies.</b> Sometimes called “preference cookies,”
          these first-party cookies allow us to remember information you have
          entered or choices you have made (such as your username, language,
          region, and marketing preferences) on our sites, so the next time you
          visit the site you will not have to set them again. These cookies also
          allow us to provide a better user experience on our website.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Targeting Cookies.</b> The Company and our advertising partners or
          other third-party partners may use these types of cookies, also known
          as “advertising cookies,” to deliver advertising and track ad
          performance, and enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may
          be relevant to you based upon your activities (this is sometimes
          called “behavioral” or “targeted” advertising) on our sites.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="heading3 pl32 italic">
        How can you manage and delete cookies?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Almost all browsers use cookies to track your internet use
        automatically. However, these browsers also allow you to change the
        settings in your browser to manage your cookie settings to delete any
        previously sent cookies and to not accept new cookies. Again, please
        keep in mind that disabling cookies will negatively impact your user
        experience with our site. Please review your browser’s settings and
        preferences for more information on how to manage and delete cookies.

      <h3 className="heading2 pl32">
        6) Does the Company use any other user tracking technologies?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Technology used on the Internet is constantly changing. The company uses
        technology standard to the Internet, such as pixel tags, web beacons,
        and other similar technologies, to track visitors to our sites.
      </p>
      <h3 className="heading2 pl32">
        7) How do we respond to “Do Not Track” Signals?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding
        tracking mechanisms, which may include "Do Not Track" instructions. You
        can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and
        similar technologies through your browser. For more information on Do

        12) What Additional Rights do EEA Residents Have?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you are resident outside the United States, including in United
        Kingdom, Switzerland, the EEA; European Economic Area (“EEA”), which
        includes the member states of the European Union (“EU”), we transfer
        Personal Data provided by you for processing in the United States,
        including Personal Information sent via e-mails or when you create an
        account. Under the GDPR, we are considered a “controller” and a
        “co-processor” of the Personal Data of EEA Residents. By providing
        Personal Data to us for the purpose of using the service, website or
        mobile application, you consent to the processing of such data in the
        United States. The transfer of your Personal Data to the United States
        is necessary for the performance of a contract between you and us for
        your use of the website or mobile application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the United States does not have data protection laws
        equivalent to those in the EEA and other jurisdictions.

        <h3 className="heading3">Rights of EEA Residents</h3>
        <p>
          This section of the Privacy Policy is applicable to residents of the
          EEA, which consists of the member states of the European Union. This
          section also applies to residents of Switzerland and residents of the
          United Kingdom. Residents of the EEA, UK and Switzerland are referred
          to here as “EEA Residents.”
        </p>
        <p>
          All processing of Personal Data of EEA Residents is performed by us in
          accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679) of
          the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of
          natural persons regarding the processing of Personal Data and on the
          free movement of such data (“GDPR”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the GDPR, we are both the controller and a co-processor of the
          Personal Data of EEA Residents. Our purpose for collecting and
          processing Personal Data from EEA Residents is to provide them with
          the features and functionalities of our website and mobile application
          and information regarding our services. The legal basis for collecting
          Personal Data is because it is necessary for performance of a contract
          between us to provide you with the website and mobile application and
          its related features and functionality. We also rely on your consent
          to receive information about our services. You may withdraw consent
          from receiving marketing and promotional communications by clicking
          the “Update Email Preferences” link on the communication. If EEA
          Residents do not provide Personal Data to us or withdraw consent for
          processing such Personal Data, we may not be able to provide such
          residents with certain features or functionalities of the website or
          mobile application or information regarding the services, including
          processing payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to access personal
          information we hold about you and to ask that your personal
          information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to
          exercise this right, please contact us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:hello@riot.fun">hello@riot.fun</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, if you are an EEA resident, we are hereby notifying you
          that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts
          we might have with you, or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business
          interests listed above. Additionally, please note that your
          information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the
          United States.

          Security of Transmission of Personal Information and Risks Related to
          the Internet
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our website and mobile application have security measures in place to
          help protect against the loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access,
          disclosure, alteration and destruction of the information under the
          company’s control. The website uses no encryption (data scrambling) on
          certain portions of the website, but does use encryption on portions
          where you are transmitting financial information, such as credit card
          information. When you are on any website that asks you for
          confidential information, you should check to see if the information
          being transmitted is encrypted in order to increase the security of
          your information. Although every effort is made to ensure no one else
          will view, seize or obtain your information, complete confidentiality
          and security is not yet possible over the Internet. Any unencrypted
          email communication over the Internet is not secure or confidential,
          and is subject to possible interception, loss and alteration. The
          company, its agents, administrators, employees and affiliates may not
          be held liable for any damages you or anyone else may suffer or incur
          as a result of the transmission of confidential or sensitive
          information over the Internet, and all such communications will be
          made at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative
          measures to protect Personal Information under our control. For
          example, we seek to use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology for
          all financial transactions conducted through the website or mobile
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, no data storage system or data transmission over the
          Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please also be aware
          that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide
          hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms
          and conditions that may be non-negotiable; these service providers
          have informed us or the general public that they apply security
          measures they consider adequate for the protection of information
          within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying
          such measures.
