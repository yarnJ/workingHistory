      <p>
        Riot Racers is a play to earn car racing game where players and
        participants own parts of the game. Players can earn by playing the game
        or by simply owning parts of the game. All ownable parts of the game are
        in the form of verifiably owned NFTs. The currency of the game is the
        RIOT Token, used for all in game activities. RIOT is a fungible ERC-721
        token and was created by deploying a widely used standard smart contract
        on the Ethereum blockchain. To be used in the game, RIOT may be bridged
        to the Matic network (a 2nd layer chain to Ethereum) or used from the
        Ethereum mainnet.
